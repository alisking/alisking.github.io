					This is where you would introduce yourself. You might include links to things <a href="//google.com">RANDOM LINK TO GOOGLE</a>. You might have links to outside websites or things like your resume.
					
					You might also talk about groups that you have worked with (and perhaps link to them), and/or put your interests here!

			                <p> I am currently working on my Master's in Biostatistics with a focus in Data Science at the University of Washington. I have a BS in Applied Mathematics from Loyola Marymount University where I was also captain of the Division I women's soccer team. I have experience in sports science and statistics, as well as research experience in predictive modeling and visualization of education and public health datasets.</p>
					
					<p> My interests lie in finding innovative ways to improve the health of people and populations through data, and I have taken courses in the areas of medical study design, longitudinal data analysis, and hypothesis testing, among others.

		<strong>Efficacy of Freeze-Dried Plasma Compared to Fresh-Frozen Plasma During Massive Transfusion Protocol in Injured Adults: A Randomized, Double-blind Clinical Trial</strong><br>
                <ul>
                <li> As part of a quarter-long class project, designed and wrote up a proposal for a clinical trial. </li>
		<li> Designed statistical methods to assess risk difference between two treatment groups, while ensuring trial protocol follows ethical guidelines. </li>
